<div class="entry-content"><p><strong>This is a cross-post of a post of a post I made to the Benchling Engineering
blog. <a href="https://benchling.engineering/from-200k-lines-of-coffeescript-to-zero-making-decaffeinate-super-stable-4de0ca68d9bc">See the original post.</a></strong></p>

<p>The world of frontend development evolves so quickly that sometimes it feels
impossible to keep up. Even worse, what do you do with your existing code when
technologies shift? Innovations in languages, libraries, and practices are
great, but they’re only useful if they can be used in practice. To enable new
technologies, we need good modernization tools to aid in the transition process.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://benchling.com/enterprise">Benchling</a>, we chose CoffeeScript in 2013,
but about a year and a half ago, we recognized that the language was losing
steam. The community and the tools were all moving to JavaScript, and with
ES2015, JavaScript was getting much, much better. We made a decision: <strong>New code
will be in JavaScript, and for now, the 200,000 lines of CoffeeScript will stay
as-is. We’ll convert code over to JS as we find time for it.</strong> We wanted to be
entirely on JavaScript, of course, but converting that much code seemed like a
gigantic task.</p>

<p>I took that as a challenge, and a year and a half later, I’m happy to say that
that gigantic task is now complete. We’re finally at zero lines of CoffeeScript,
all with minimal disruption to feature work. At the time, there weren’t good
tools for such a big conversion, so I had to help build them. I started
contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate">decaffeinate</a>
open source project, became the primary maintainer, and pushed it to completion.
This post is about that long journey, and now that a tool like decaffeinate
exists, it probably won’t take as long for you. 😄</p>

<h2>Why switch to JavaScript?</h2>

<p>At Benchling, we build tools to help biologists coordinate experiments, analyze
and work with DNA, and more, and one of our strengths is our modern platform. We
need to build and iterate quickly, so it’s important that we always have access
to the latest and greatest tools. (<a href="http://grnh.se/wt7plq">We’re also hiring!</a>)</p>

<p>We started with CoffeeScript in 2013, and that was the right choice at the time.
The JavaScript language was at a standstill, and CoffeeScript overhauled it by
introducing arrow functions, classes, destructuring, string templates, array
spread, and lots of other cool features. It certainly had problems, like lack of
standardization, surprises around variable scoping, and difficulty writing
tooling, but it was the best there was.</p>

<p>Over the next few years, JavaScript made a comeback. Inspired largely by many of
the CoffeeScript features, the JavaScript committee released the ES2015 spec
(a.k.a. ES6) that moved the language up to parity with CoffeeScript in some
cases and beyond in other cases, and with Babel, it was possible to use modern
JavaScript in any browser without waiting. The community became focused on
JavaScript, so the tools got better. <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> now has
hundreds of rules and many competing popular default configurations,
<a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a> is a whole new class of formatter, and
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> and <a href="https://flow.org/">Flow</a>
allow advanced type checking while staying true to JS. Switching programming
languages is never an easy choice, but it seemed like JavaScript was a safer
long-term bet, and it’s easy to use the two side-by-side, so writing new code in
JavaScript seemed reasonable.</p>

<p>Having a split codebase is possible, but it ended up hurting productivity when
working with older code. Switching back and forth between two languages is a
pain, and two frontend languages meant more for new hires to learn and more
trivial style rules to keep track of. And, of course, our new tools like ESLint
couldn’t help when modifying old CoffeeScript code, where they probably would be
most useful. A unified JavaScript codebase seemed like the right end goal.</p>

<h2>First idea: convert the code by hand</h2>

<p>One day in June 2016, a coworker decided to be ambitious: he was working with a
complex 500-line React component, GuideGroupTable.coffee, and he was going to
port it to ES6 first to make it easier to work with. Line-by-line, he carefully
reworked the syntax and some of the logic until finally, GuideGroupTable.js was
ready to try out. It broke the first time, and the second, but after fixing some
little mistakes, things seemed to work, and he wrote some additional tests to
gain more confidence in the conversion.</p>

<p>Even with tests, and even with a thorough code review, making such a big change
to complex code is risky, and it ended up introducing two bugs. In all,
converting the code, getting it reviewed, and fixing the resulting bugs took
about two engineer-days total. But at least there was a shiny new modern-looking
GuideGroupTable.js. One file down, about 1000 more to go.</p>

<p><strong>Math quiz:</strong> If every 500 lines of CoffeeScript converted takes 2 days and
introduces 2 bugs, how many days and bugs is it for 200,000 lines?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 800 days (or 6,400 hours), 800 bugs.</p>

<p>Spending over 3 engineer-years on switching programming languages would be a
disastrous waste of time, especially for a startup; that’s time that could be
spent working on real problems that scientists are facing. At the end of the
day, <strong>cancer doesn’t care what programming language we use</strong>, and if sticking
with CoffeeScript is the pragmatic choice, that’s what we’ll do.</p>

<p>Maybe this was just a particularly difficult case and other code would be
easier. Even if these estimates are too high by a factor of ten, 640 hours and
80 bugs is still way too much to ask. If we’re going to move off of CoffeeScript
at all, there needs to be a better way.</p>

<h2>Second idea: the CoffeeScript compiler</h2>

<p>In a certain sense, automatically converting CoffeeScript to JavaScript is
trivial: just run it through the CoffeeScript compiler. The newest versions of
CoffeeScript (which didn’t exist at the time) produce pretty good code, but
<a href="http://coffeescript.org/#try:toolbarMouseOverHandler%20%3D%20%28fmt%29%20-%3E%0A%20%20%20%20attachFmts%20%3D%20%5B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%27table%27%2C%20%27day%27%2C%20%27attach%27%2C%20DATA_TABLE%2C%20DATA_TABLE_CONFIG%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20REGISTRATION_TABLE%2C%20NOTE_LINKED_ASSAY_DATA%0A%20%20%20%20%5D%0A%20%20%20%20%7Bindex%2C%20subIndex%7D%20%3D%20%40state.selected%0A%20%20%20%20%0A%20%20%20%20if%20fmt%20in%20%5B%27left%27%2C%20%27center%27%2C%20%27right%27%2C%20%27important%27%5D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%40setState%20%7BhighlightIndex%3A%20index%7D%0A%20%20%20%20else%20if%20fmt%20%3D%3D%20%27delete%27%20and%20subIndex%20!%3D%20%27item%27%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%40setState%20%7BhighlightIndex%3A%20index%7D%0A%20%20%20%20else%20if%20fmt%20in%20attachFmts%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%40setState%20%7BinsertIndex%3A%20index%7D%0A%20%20%20%20return">there’s still quite a bit to be desired</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>It reformats your code: it switches to two-space indentation, it deletes blank
lines, it sometimes expands one-liners to multiple lines, and it sometimes joins
multi-line expressions into one long line.</li>
<li>It always uses <code>var</code> and declares all variables at the top of the file/function.</li>
<li>It sometimes generates awkward code for the sake of strict correctness, like
using <code>void 0</code> instead of <code>undefined</code> or <code>[].indexOf.call(array, x)</code> instead of
<code>array.indexOf(x)</code>.
If you’re still on CoffeeScript version 1, you’ll see more issues: that compiler
also removes inline comments and doesn’t attempt to use newer JS features like
classes and destructuring.</li>
</ul>


<p>In short, the CoffeeScript compiler is a good compiler, but not a great codebase
conversion tool, so we decided to look for other approaches.</p>

<h2>Third idea: decaffeinate</h2>

<p>We weren’t the only company with this problem, and through some discussions, I
heard about a tool called <a href="https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate">decaffeinate</a>
that tried to solve this problem: it took
in CoffeeScript and produced modern JavaScript, at least as much as it could.
Unlike the CoffeeScript compiler, <a href="http://decaffeinate-project.org/repl/#?evaluate=true&amp;stage=full&amp;code=toolbarMouseOverHandler%20%3D%20%28fmt%29%20-%3E%0A%20%20%20%20attachFmts%20%3D%20%5B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%27table%27%2C%20%27day%27%2C%20%27attach%27%2C%20DATA_TABLE%2C%20DATA_TABLE_CONFIG%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20REGISTRATION_TABLE%2C%20NOTE_LINKED_ASSAY_DATA%0A%20%20%20%20%5D%0A%20%20%20%20%7Bindex%2C%20subIndex%7D%20%3D%20%40state.selected%0A%20%20%20%20%0A%20%20%20%20if%20fmt%20in%20%5B%27left%27%2C%20%27center%27%2C%20%27right%27%2C%20%27important%27%5D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%40setState%20%7BhighlightIndex%3A%20index%7D%0A%20%20%20%20else%20if%20fmt%20%3D%3D%20%27delete%27%20and%20subIndex%20!%3D%20%27item%27%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%40setState%20%7BhighlightIndex%3A%20index%7D%0A%20%20%20%20else%20if%20fmt%20in%20attachFmts%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%40setState%20%7BinsertIndex%3A%20index%7D%0A%20%20%20%20return">it keeps your formatting and tries to use modern syntax and patterns</a>.</p>

<p>I installed it and tried it out on our codebase. Out of 1200 files, it failed on
about 600 of them. On the plus side, <strong>it successfully converted half of the
files</strong>.</p>

<p>It was promising, but it certainly wasn’t done. Lots of features were explicitly
not supported: <code>?.</code>, <code>for own</code> loops, loops used as expressions, complex class
bodies, and more. And most of the time, you’d get a confusing error like
“Unexpected token” with no further context.</p>

<p>I hadn’t made many GitHub contributions before, but it seemed like a reasonable
place to start. I filed some bugs, improved some error reporting, learned the
code better and better, and eventually, I was a regular contributor. For the
last year or so, I’ve been the primary maintainer.</p>

<p>If you want to try it out, the <a href="http://decaffeinate-project.org/repl/">REPL</a> is
a nice interactive environment where you can type or paste some CoffeeScript and
see what decaffeinate produces.</p>

<h2>How does decaffeinate work?</h2>

<p>Is decaffeinate a compiler? Maybe it’s a <em>trans</em>piler? (Is that really any
different?) I’d say it’s neither; it’s something else entirely. It’s similar to
a compiler, but it has different goals and, in this case, a different
architecture.</p>

<h3>The CoffeeScript compiler approach: code → AST → code</h3>

<p>First, let’s see how the CoffeeScript compiler handles some example code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffee'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="nx">isHappy</span> <span class="k">then</span> <span class="nx">cheer</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>First, it splits the code up into <strong>tokens</strong>: <code>IF</code>, <code>IDENTIFIER: isHappy</code>, <code>THEN</code>,
<code>IDENTIFIER: cheer</code>, <code>CALL_START</code>, <code>CALL_END</code>, <code>TERMINATOR</code>.</p>

<p>Then, it parses the tokens into an <strong>abstract syntax tree</strong> (AST):</p>

<p><img src="/images/coffee_ast.png" alt="CoffeeScript AST" /></p>

<p>Each AST node then knows how to format itself into JavaScript code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">isHappy</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">cheer</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Notice that the one-liner was expanded to multiple lines. CoffeeScript doesn’t
take any formatting into account when producing output, since it throws away the
code and only uses the AST when generating JavaScript.</p>

<h3>The decaffeinate approach: targeted replacement</h3>

<p>Many of the details in decaffeinate are similar, but it focuses on <em>editing your
code, not rewriting it</em>. Rather than producing new code, it uses the AST and
tokens to generate a list of changes to the code. In this case, decaffeinate
uses the token positions to recognize that the <code>if</code> statement is a one-liner, then
makes these changes:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Insert "(" before "isHappy"
</span><span class='line'>Insert ")" after "isHappy"
</span><span class='line'>Delete "then "
</span><span class='line'>Insert "{ " before "cheer()"
</span><span class='line'>Insert ";" after "cheer()"
</span><span class='line'>Insert " }" after "cheer()"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Those operations are then applied to the original code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">isHappy</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">cheer</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Your code only changes where it needs to, and in most cases, the shape of the
code is the same as before.</p>

<p>Is this the right architecture? Frankly, it’s unclear, and projects like
<a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a> have made a compelling argument that codebases
should simply have zero manual formatting anyway. But it’s the architecture
decaffeinate went with.</p>

<h2>Is it even possible?</h2>

<p>When building an automatic translation from one programming language to another,
you run into an uncomfortable possibility: <strong>the problem you’re solving might be
impossible</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s take an example. Ideally, CoffeeScript classes can always be converted to
JavaScript classes. Here’s one CoffeeScript class that uses a feature you may
not have seen:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffee'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nx">Giraffe</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nx">ENABLE_LOUD_GIRAFFES</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nv">roar: </span><span class="nf">-&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">&#39;ROAR!!!&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">else</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nv">roar: </span><span class="nf">-&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">&#39;roar...&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Yep, you can do that in CoffeeScript! Not only can you conditionally define
methods, you can run arbitrary code at class setup time. JS classes can only
consist of plain methods (for now), so there simply isn’t a way to do this. You
can try, and you’ll get a syntax error:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kr">class</span> <span class="nx">Giraffe</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">ENABLE_LOUD_GIRAFFES</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">roar</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>  <span class="c1">// &lt;- Unexpected token, expected ; (3:11)</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">&#39;ROAR!!!&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">roar</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">&#39;roar...&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you’re moving this code over manually, you’d think to yourself “I guess that
trick doesn’t work in JavaScript, so I’ll rethink the code”, but that’s not
possible with an automated tool.</p>

<p>So how should a tool like decaffeinate approach this? There are a few options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fall back to the CoffeeScript implementation. That’s not so unreasonable, but
ideally CS classes would always become JS classes. It’s also not as easy as it
sounds, given the different architectures.</li>
<li>Throw an error, saying that this syntax isn’t supported. Anyone wanting to run
decaffeinate on code like this needs to dumb down the code first.</li>
<li>Find some trick to make it work anyway.</li>
</ol>


<p>#3 is where decaffeinate really shines: there are lots of little tricks to make
the code look as good as possible while still being correct.</p>

<p>Looks pretty clean (although you’ll get an <a href="http://coffeescript.org/#try:%23%20Creates%20an%20array%20called%20%60colors%60.%0Acolors%20%3D%20%28marker.color%20for%20marker%20in%20getMarkers%28%29%29%0A%0A%23%20Assigns%20to%20%60colors%60%20in%20each%20loop%20iteration.%0Acolors%20%3D%20marker.color%20for%20marker%20in%20getMarkers%28%29">unpleasant surprise</a> if you forget the
parens). JavaScript doesn’t have array comprehensions, so we’ll need to find
some alternative.</p>

<p>Here’s how the CoffeeScript compiler handles it:</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">})();</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Yuck. It works, but it certainly wouldn’t pass code review. Here’s what we
really want:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">colors</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">getMarkers</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nx">map</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nx">marker</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nx">marker</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">color</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Looks pretty clean, and not too different from the original code. But is it
<em>correct</em>? It certainly looks right, but would you be willing to run this
transformation (<code>a for b in c</code> to <code>c.map(b =&gt; a)</code>) on hundreds of thousands of lines
of code? As it turns out, <strong>it’s not correct</strong>. If you want, you can stop reading
and think about what goes wrong.</p>

<p>I implemented this transformation, ran decaffeinate on a few thousand lines of
code from work, did lots of testing, including existing automated tests, and it
still ended up causing a crash in production.</p>

<p>Here’s the old CoffeeScript:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffee'><span class='line'><span class="nv">cids = </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">row</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">attr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;data-id&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="nx">row</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="nx">$el</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;.alignment-row&#39;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And here’s the new JavaScript:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">cids</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">$el</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;.alignment-row&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">map</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nx">row</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">row</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">attr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;data-id&#39;</span><span class="p">));</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The fundamental problem here is that <strong>you might not be working with an array</strong>. In
this case, it was a jQuery collection, where <code>map</code> exists, but doesn’t produce an
array.</p>

<p>This problem is all over the place in CoffeeScript: every time you iterate
through something in CoffeeScript, it needs to be array-like. That means you
need <code>arr.length</code>, <code>arr[0]</code>, <code>arr[1]</code>, etc. When ES2015 came around, they decided to
do things differently: they created the <em>iterable protocol</em>. Any object that wants
to be iterable can expose a <code>Symbol.iterator</code> function that describes how to
iterate through the object. That’s what JavaScript uses for iteration when you
use <code>for (const rhino of rhinos)</code> or <code>children = [...children, baby]</code>. Arrays are
both array-like and iterable, but plenty of JS objects are array-like but not
iterable, and even more objects don’t have <code>map</code> (or have a <code>map</code> that works
differently). Strings, jQuery collections, and FileList (but only in Safari) can
all cause problems here.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there’s a simple built-in function that converts array-like objects
to true arrays: <code>Array.from</code>. To systematically avoid this problem, we can throw
in <code>Array.from</code> anywhere we iterate over anything, and <a href="http://decaffeinate-project.org/repl/#?evaluate=true&amp;stage=full&amp;code=for%20rhino%20in%20rhinos%0A%20%20console.log%20rhino%0Achildren%20%3D%20%5Bchildren...%2C%20baby%5D%0Acids%20%3D%20%28%24%28row%29.attr%28%27data-id%27%29%20for%20row%20in%20%24el.find%28%27.alignment-row%27%29%29">this is what decaffeinate does</a>.</p>

<p>This is one of the toughest design questions of decaffeinate: how important is
correctness <em>really</em>? If a bug only comes up every few thousand lines of code, do
we really want to defensively add <code>Array.from</code> on <em>all</em> iteration operators?</p>

<p>After a lot of thinking, I decided that <strong>yes, <a href="https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate/blob/master/docs/correctness-issues.md">decaffeinate should be completely correct on all reasonable code</a></strong>. There’s a judgement call about what is
“reasonable”, but decaffeinate needs to be trustworthy. decaffeinate’s goal is
to speed up the conversion from CoffeeScript to JS, and if you need to
extensively manually test your code after decaffeinate, it will take much, much
longer. decaffeinate needs to be as stable as any compiler.</p>

<p>If you use decaffeinate, you’ll probably see <code>Array.from</code> all over the place. You
can disable it with the <code>--loose</code> option, but I’d recommend instead looking through
the resulting code and only removing <code>Array.from</code> when you’re confident that the
object you’re working with is already an array.</p>

<h2>Reaching super-stability</h2>

<p>Between July and December 2016, decaffeinate slowly got more and more stable
when run on the Benchling code. 500 files failing, then 350, then 200, then 50,
then 10, then 5, then 0. After some cheers and excitement, I ran the tests for
the newly-decaffeinated codebase, and they crashed immediately. More work to do,
I guess. I fixed a bug, I fixed another bug, I tracked down and <a href="https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/7811">fixed an ESLint bug</a>, I upgraded Babel to work around a Babel bug, I kept on iterating, and
finally it got to a point of the tests passing.</p>

<p>So now what? decaffeinate seemed to work great on the code that was covered by
tests, but what about the code that wasn’t covered by tests? I could write
100,000 lines of tests to try to get full code coverage, but that might take a
while. I needed to find <em>more test cases for decaffeinate</em>, and fortunately, the
internet has no shortage of CoffeeScript code. I set up a build system that
would run decaffeinate on a bunch of projects, patch them to use Babel, then run
all of the tests. A <a href="https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate#status">status board on the README</a> was also a good motivating factor
and a good way to see progress. Here were some of the results early on:</p>

<p><img src="/images/decaffeinate_tests_before.png" alt="decaffeinate tests with many errors" /></p>

<p>Testing out decaffeinate on codebases with a wide variety of authors and coding
styles worked out great, and setting up the tests allowed me to discover the
most critical bugs. There were <a href="https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate/issues/867">lots</a> <a href="https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate/issues/858">and</a> <a href="https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate/issues/878">lots</a> <a href="https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate/issues/902">of</a> <a href="https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate/issues/882">bugs</a>, but after a few months, I
finally got everything working:</p>

<p><img src="/images/decaffeinate_tests_after.png" alt="decaffeinate tests, all passing" /></p>

<p>It’s rare that you ever get to say that a software project is complete, but I
think this is one of those times. Technically, there’s still a bit more that
would be useful, and I did some follow-up work to add a suggestions system and
clean up usage, but decaffeinate is now in maintenance mode.</p>

<h2>Getting to zero</h2>

<p>With decaffeinate stable, we were finally at a point where it wasn’t crazy to
run it on large swaths of code without extensive testing or review. So what do
you do when you have a tool like that and 150,000 lines of CoffeeScript to
convert? Somehow, converting it all at once seemed a little worrying.</p>

<p>Here’s the strategy we took: every Tuesday, we’d pick off a large chunk of code
and run it through decaffeinate, first about 5000 lines, then larger and larger
chunks, up to 20,000 lines at once. We always had a 100%-machine-automated set
of commits, then two of us scanned through the converted code and made any safe
cleanups we could find. That did not mean blindly removing all usages of
<code>Array.from</code> or other decaffeinate artifacts; it meant fixing formatting, removing
unused variables, renaming autogenerated variables to other names, etc. The code
at the end wasn’t pristine, but it was JavaScript, and it was much better than
what the CoffeeScript compiler gives.</p>

<p>The stability work paid off, and after repeating this process for about 10
weeks, we finally were able to get it completely to zero with very few issues.
That also meant that it was possible to remove CoffeeScript from the build
system, disable CoffeeLint, and delete our CoffeeScript style guide.</p>

<p>In a sense, the job still isn’t done. We still have lots of files with
decaffeinate artifacts and disabled lint rules that should eventually be
manually cleaned up. One of our biggest auto-converted files starts with this:</p>

<p>So it’s not perfect, but it’s pretty easy to do the remaining cleanup work as
you go.</p>

<p>Let’s compare my original estimate with the actual cost of converting 200,000
lines of code:</p>

<p><strong>Estimated cost without decaffeinate:</strong> 6,400 hours, 800 bugs.</p>

<p><strong>Actual cost with decaffeinate:</strong> ~100 hours, ~5 bugs.</p>

<p>(Not including the work on decaffeinate, which was in my spare time. 😄).</p>

<p>Those 100 hours were mostly spent spot-checking and cleaning up the resulting
JS, code reviewing those cleanups, manually testing the relevant features, and
deploying the changes gradually to reduce risk. 2000 lines of code per hour
seemed like a safe rate, but theoretically, it could have all been done at once,
and if you’re in a hurry, you could probably go much faster.</p>

<h2>What went wrong?</h2>

<p>decaffeinate is extremely stable, but the conversion process still wasn’t
without its bugs. By far, the largest source of bugs was <strong>human error</strong>. Let’s look
at some code, before and after decaffeinate:</p>

<p>decaffeinate moved the default param to an <code>if</code> statement <a href="https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate/blob/master/docs/suggestions.md#ds105-use-default-params-and-defaults-within-assignments-when-possible">in order to be
technically correct</a>, wrapped <code>itemIdsToKeep</code> in <code>Array.from</code>, and changed the <code>in</code>
operator to the <code>includes</code> method. The <code>if</code> statement and the <code>Array.from</code> could both
use cleanup, and in this case we played it safe and only removed the <code>Array.from</code>,
since it clearly seemed like an array:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As it turns out, <code>itemIdsToKeep</code> was <strong>not</strong> always an array. Purely by mistake, it
could sometimes be a <em>DOM event</em> instead. Both CoffeeScript and <code>Array.from</code>
silently treat it as the empty array in that case, but removing <code>Array.from</code>
exposed the crash.</p>

<p>This is an example of a theme that occurred a number of times: <strong>decaffeinate
tends to break on code that is already buggy</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at another example. Here’s some CoffeeScript before and JavaScript
after:</p>

<p>Seems pretty simple, right? What could go wrong?</p>

<p>As it turns out, the problem wasn’t so much a conversion error as an unexpected
consequence in switching compilers: <strong>switching from CoffeeScript to Babel enables
strict mode</strong>. Without strict mode, assigning to a non-writable property is a
no-op, and in strict mode it crashes. In this case, <code>response</code> was supposed to be
an object, but instead was sometimes <em>the empty string</em>, which meant that the
assignment simply did nothing. This was just a bug, but it was a benign bug
before and switching to Babel made it a crashing bug.</p>

<p>How can you avoid running into these same problems? Some ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Try to defer extensive manual cleanups until you’re working heavily with the
code and are comfortable testing all of its edge cases. Over and over, we found
that a cleanup that seemed safe actually had subtle flaws, and often times it
was best to just go with the decaffeinate output.</li>
<li>You may want to move to strict mode separately from moving to JS. One way to do
this is with the <a href="https://github.com/genify/babel-plugin-transform-remove-strict-mode">babel-plugin-transform-remove-strict-mode</a> Babel plugin. That
will keep you on the lookout for the types of errors that arise in strict mode.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Other things to know before using decaffeinate</h2>

<p>Here are some more things to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The hardest problem that decaffeinate had to solve is handling <code>this</code> before <code>super</code>
in constructors, which is allowed in CS but not in JS. There’s a <a href="https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate/blob/master/docs/suggestions.md#ds001-remove-babeltypescript-constructor-workaround">hack</a> to trick
Babel and TypeScript into allowing it, but it’s an ugly hack that you should
remove ASAP after running decaffeinate.</p></li>
<li><p>To help run decaffeinate along with other tools, I wrote a tool called
<a href="https://github.com/decaffeinate/bulk-decaffeinate">bulk-decaffeinate</a> that runs decaffeinate, several jscodeshift transforms (e.g.
converting code to JSX), <code>eslint --fix</code> and several other steps. You’ll probably
want to either use that tool or one you write yourself, since decaffeinate is
more of a building block.</p></li>
<li><p>There have been some great previous blog posts on decaffeinate: <a href="https://blog.bugsnag.com/converting-a-large-react-codebase-from-coffeescript-to-es6/">Converting a large React Codebase from Coffeescript to ES6</a> and
<a href="https://eng.datafox.com/javascript/2017/07/18/decaffeinating-large-coffeescript-codebase/">Decaffeinating a Large CoffeeScript Codebase Without Losing Sleep</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The decaffeinate docs have some pages to help you through the process: the
<a href="https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate/blob/master/docs/conversion-guide.md">Conversion Guide</a> has some practical advice on running decaffeinate on a big
codebase, and the Cleanup <a href="https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate/blob/master/docs/suggestions.md">Suggestions page</a> lists most of the subtleties you’ll
see in the converted code. You can also drop in on <a href="https://gitter.im/decaffeinate/Lobby">Gitter</a> to ask questions!</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Every project and team is different, though, so regardless of how you approach
it, you’ll likely need some real effort and care. But hopefully, once the
conversion strategy, the configuration, and any other details are figured out,
the gruntwork will all be safely handled by decaffeinate!</p>

<h2>Migration tools let you focus on what’s important</h2>

<p>Programming is full of tradeoffs, and a common pitfall is to focus too much on
your code when you should be focusing on the real problem that you’re solving.
Whether it’s formatting, variable names, code structure, or even what
programming language to use, none of it matters if the product doesn’t actually
help people. Big code migrations can sometimes feel necessary and benefit in the
long run, but they can also be a big distraction and a massive time sink. It’s
often an awkward tradeoff, but with solid migration tools like decaffeinate, you
can get the best of both worlds: you can benefit from the latest tools and
practices while still focusing your time and brainpower on solving real problems
and helping people.</p>
