I'm a full-stack software engineer at [Benchling](https://benchling.com/enterprise).
These days, I mostly focus on frontend tech, but I have a wide range of other
interests: CS theory, math, compilers, distributed systems, software engineering,
Android, and lots of other things.

Previously, I was at Khan Academy, where I worked on the infrastructure team.
Among other things, I worked on the A/B testing framework and the API, and
helped build the first version of the Android app.

Before that, I worked at Palantir, where I worked on improving scale (migrating
from Oracle to a distributed database) and avoiding downtime (reworking the
Reindex operation to work with the system up).

I also had internships at Mozilla and VMware.

I graduated from CMU in 2011 with a double major in computer science and math.
I'm particularly proud of my [senior thesis](/files/senior_thesis.pdf),
although I probably won't ever travel that far into theory land ever again.

I also wrote [theproofistrivial.com](http://www.theproofistrivial.com).

I'm also on [GitHub](https://github.com/alangpierce) and
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/alangpierce).
