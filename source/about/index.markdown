I'm a software engineer at [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org). I work on
the infrastructure team, which mostly focuses on site performance and developer
happiness.

Before that, I was on Palantir's infrastructure team from May 2011 to January
2014, where I worked on improving scale and avoiding downtime. I also had
internships at Mozilla and VMware.

I graduated from CMU in 2011 with a double major in computer science and math.
I'm particularly proud of my [senior thesis](/files/senior_thesis.pdf),
although I probably won't ever travel that far into theory land ever again.

I also wrote [theproofistrivial.com](http://www.theproofistrivial.com).
